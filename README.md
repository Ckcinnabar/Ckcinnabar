# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kuan-Chen Chen

🎓 Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Applied Data Science at the University of Florida, where I'm diving deep into the world of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. (Expected December 2025)

🌟 I'm a data scientist and ML engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. From fine-tuning large language models to developing deep learning architectures for audio processing, I thrive on transforming complex data into actionable insights and production-ready solutions.

🤖 Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong expertise in end-to-end AI development. I fine-tuned DistilGPT-2 on 522K recipes for cAIuldron, an AI-powered recipe generation platform that implements RAG architecture with Pinecone vector database and delivers real-time nutritional analysis through an intuitive Streamlit interface. I also built a Speech Emotion Recognition System using a CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture that achieved 87.41% accuracy on the RAVDESS dataset, implementing sophisticated mel-spectrogram feature extraction and data augmentation techniques to ensure model robustness.

🚀 My passion for smart mobility solutions led me to develop DARTS, a campus bike-sharing demand prediction system that achieved 86.1% accuracy using LSTM neural networks. This project integrated multi-source data including weather patterns and campus events, and became a Top 10 national finalist among 121 competing teams. I also created a Cross-League Sports Career Modeling System that analyzes 1,800+ professional athletes across NFL, NBA, and FIFA, leveraging ensemble methods and sport-specific feature engineering to predict career trajectories.

🔬 Before my graduate studies, I was a researcher at Planning Science Lab at National Sun Yat-sen University, where I developed a deep understanding of intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility analytics.

💻 Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on NLP, deep learning, and full-stack AI deployment. My ultimate goal is to work with diverse teams of engineers and researchers to develop cutting-edge AI solutions that make a meaningful impact on people's lives.

🏃 Outside of coding and research, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or staying active through outdoor activities.
